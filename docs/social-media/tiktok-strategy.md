# Listelee.io TikTok Content Strategy

## 1. Primary Goal

To build an engaged community of aspiring Turkish founders and establish Listelee.io as the go-to tool for validating new business ideas. We will achieve this by becoming a primary source of inspiration, practical advice, and relatable stories for the Turkish startup ecosystem.

## 2. Target Audience

- **Primary:** University students and young professionals in Turkey (18-30 years old) with an interest in technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship. They are ambitious, digitally native, but may lack the technical skills or confidence to start.
- **Secondary:** Experienced professionals or small business owners in Turkey looking to launch a new digital product or service.

## 3. Core Content Pillars

Our content will be built around four key pillars to ensure a balanced and engaging feed.

| Pillar | Description | Content-Type | Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pillar 1: Inspiration (Duygu)** | Motivate aspiring founders by sharing success stories, highlighting the "founder journey," and normalizing the fear of failure. Connect on an emotional level. | Storytelling, quotes from successful founders (Turkish & global), cinematic edits showing the "hustle" culture, celebrating small wins. | Build an emotional connection. Make followers feel understood and empowered. |
| **Pillar 2: Education (Bilgi)** | Provide actionable, bite-sized advice on idea validation, market research, and building an MVP. Position Listelee.io as a knowledgeable guide. | Quick tips, "How-To" tutorials (e.g., "3 ways to test your idea this weekend"), explaining startup concepts (MVP, Pivot, etc.) in simple Turkish, screen-recorded guides. | Build trust and authority. Become a valuable resource that people save and share. |
| **Pillar 3: Product (Araç)** | Showcase Listelee.io in action, but always in the context of solving a problem. The product is the "how" to the "why" from the other pillars. | "Founder Mode" AI demos, creating a landing page in under 60 seconds, showing the user dashboard, case studies of Listelee.io users. | Drive product sign-ups. Show, don't just tell, how easy it is to get started. |
| **Pillar 4: Community (Topluluk)** | Feature and celebrate our users. Make the community the hero of our story. | Replying to comments with video, featuring a user's Listelee.io page, asking questions to the audience ("What's a business idea you're afraid to start?"), running polls. | Foster a loyal community. Create a sense of belonging and user-generated social proof. |

## 4. Posting Strategy

- **Frequency:** 1 video per day, 5-7 days a week. Consistency is crucial on TikTok.
- **Best Times to Post (Turkey):**
  - Weekdays: 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM (Lunch Break), 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM (After Work/School)
  - Weekends: 2:00 PM - 10:00 PM
- **Hashtag Strategy:** Use a mix of broad, niche, and branded hashtags.
  - **Broad:** `#girişimcilik`, `#startup`, `#teknoloji`, `#işfikri`
  - **Niche:** `#mvp`, `#pazardoğrulama`, `#beklemelitesi`
  - **Branded:** `#listeleio`, `#fikrinilistele`
- **Sound Strategy:** Use trending sounds, but always have a high-quality voiceover and subtitles. The message is more important than the meme.

## 5. Content Funnel

1.  **Top of Funnel (Awareness):** Inspiration and broad Education videos. These are designed to go viral and reach new audiences. (e.g., "The story of how Trendyol started").
2.  **Middle of Funnel (Consideration):** Niche Education and problem-focused Product videos. This content is for people who are now considering starting a project. (e.g., "Stop building apps, build a waiting list first. Here's how.").
3.  **Bottom of Funnel (Conversion):** Direct Product showcases and Community-driven content. This is for users who are ready to try Listelee.io. (e.g., "Watch me build a landing page for my coffee subscription idea in 45 seconds with Listelee.io").

## 6. Tone & Style

- **Voice:** Authentic, motivational, and supportive. Speak like a knowledgeable friend, not a corporation. Use the language from `FOUNDER_MODE.md` - we are talking to "Kurucular" (Founders).
- **Visuals:** Fast-paced edits, engaging text overlays, high-quality stock footage mixed with screen recordings and potentially a face-to-camera host down the line. Use **Captions.ai** for dynamic subtitles.

By executing this strategy, Listelee.io will not just be a tool; it will be the starting point of the founder community in Turkey.
