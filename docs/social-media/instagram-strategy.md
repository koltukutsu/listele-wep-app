# Listelee.io Instagram Content Strategy

## 1. Primary Goal

To establish Listelee.io as a credible and inspiring authority in the Turkish startup ecosystem. On Instagram, the focus will be on building a visually appealing brand and providing high-value, "savable" content that aspiring founders can refer back to.

## 2. Target Audience

Similar to TikTok, but with a potentially stronger concentration of young professionals (22-35) and design-conscious students. Users on Instagram often look for more in-depth information and polished aesthetics compared to TikTok.

## 3. Core Content Pillars & Formats

We will use Instagram's various formats to bring our four pillars to life.

| Pillar | Format | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pillar 1: Inspiration (Duygu)** | **Reels:** Cinematic, quick-cut videos showing founder stories, motivational quotes with epic background music. Similar to TikTok but perhaps with a more polished visual style.<br/>**Single Image Posts:** Aesthetically pleasing quote graphics from famous Turkish and international founders. |
| **Pillar 2: Education (Bilgi)** | **Carousels:** This is the key format for education on Instagram. Create 5-10 slide carousels that break down complex topics (e.g., "5 Adımda Pazar Araştırması," "MVP Nedir? Neden Önemlidir?"). These are highly savable and shareable.<br/>**Reels:** Quick tip videos, "did you know?" style facts about startups. |
| **Pillar 3: Product (Araç)** | **Reels:** Screen-recorded demos showing the "magic" of Listelee.io (e.g., AI "Founder Mode," 60-second page creation).<br/>**Carousels:** Step-by-step guides on how to use a specific feature. The final slide should always be a strong Call to Action. |
| **Pillar 4: Community (Topluluk)** | **Stories:** The primary home for community engagement. Use polls, Q&As ("Ask me anything about your startup idea"), quizzes, and share user-generated content.<br/>**Feed Posts (Carousel/Single Image):** Feature a "Founder of the Week" with a picture of them and a summary of their idea/Listelee.io page. |

## 4. Posting Strategy

- **Frequency:** 3-4 Reels per week, 2-3 Carousels per week, Daily Stories.
- **Best Times to Post (Turkey):**
  - Weekdays: 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM, 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM
  - Weekends: 3:00 PM - 9:00 PM
- **Hashtag Strategy:** Similar to TikTok, but with more emphasis on community-building tags.
  - **Broad:** `#girişimcilik`, `#startup`, `#dijitalpazarlama`, `#markayönetimi`
  - **Niche:** `#işmodeli`, `#yatırımcısunumu`, `#kullanıcıdeneyimi`
  - **Community:** `#türkgirişimciler`, `#listeleiokurucuları`
  - **Branded:** `#listeleio`, `#fikrinilistele`
- **Stories:** Use Stories for daily, informal interaction. Behind-the-scenes content, polls, Q&As, and sharing other relevant posts. Use the "Link" sticker to drive traffic directly to Listelee.io.

## 5. Content Funnel

1.  **Top of Funnel (Awareness):** Inspirational Reels and highly-valuable educational Carousels. The goal is to get saves, shares, and follows from the target audience.
2.  **Middle of Funnel (Consideration):** Product-focused Reels that solve a specific problem. Educational content that directly relates to the features of Listelee.io.
3.  **Bottom of Funnel (Conversion):** Strong Call-to-Action posts (e.g., "Ready to validate your idea? Create your waiting list now. Link in bio!"). User-generated content and case studies.

## 6. Tone & Visual Style

- **Voice:** Professional yet approachable. Authoritative but not arrogant. Maintain the "Founder-centric" language from `FOUNDER_MODE.md`.
- **Visuals:** Maintain a consistent and clean aesthetic. Use the brand's color palette (as defined in `app.mdc`). Use high-quality templates for Carousels and quote posts. Ensure all visuals are modern and align with the "cool," fast, and intuitive nature of the brand.

By leveraging Instagram's strengths for visual storytelling and in-depth educational content, Listelee.io will build a brand that is not only seen as useful but also as a credible and aspirational leader in the Turkish startup community.
